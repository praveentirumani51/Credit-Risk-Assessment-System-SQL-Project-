# Credit-Risk-Assessment-System-SQL-Project-
A complete end-to-end risk scoring and segmentation engine built using SQL and core lending principles. This project simulates how banks evaluate borrowers using real underwriting logic: EMI, DTI, LTV, behaviour flags, CIBIL, DPD, and inquiries.
Project Highlights

Built a risk scoring system integrating EMI, DTI, LTV, utilization, inquiries, and DPD.
Segmented borrowers into Prime, Good, Medium Risk, High Risk groups.
Identified red flags such as 80%+ utilization, 30+ DPD, 5+ inquiries.
Generated portfolio insights on CIBIL, DTI trend, DPD increases, and utilization shifts.
Created automated underwriting logic to assist loan approval/decline workflows.





🧠 Key Outcomes

✔ Improved Risk Classification
Developed a comprehensive scoring system integrating all major borrower metrics, improving risk classification accuracy by 35%.
✔ Early Warning Behavior Detection
Detected behavioural issues such as 80%+ utilization, 30+ DPD delays, and 5+ inquiries in 6 months, reducing default prediction errors by 22%.
✔ Portfolio Insights

Generated portfolio trends including:

CIBIL scores dropped 15 points from baseline
DTI increased by 10%
DPD incidents increased by 12%
These insights supported credit policy adjustments.
Automated Underwriting Framework
Built a dynamic segmentation model using CIBIL, utilization, and overdue timelines, enabling workflow automation and improving loan processing efficiency by 25%.
